# ORAAH-Tutorials

## Tutorials for Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop release 2.8.x
**The [Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop][1] (ORAAH) is a set of R packages and Java libraries**
**It provides several features:**
- An R interface for manipulating data stored in a local File System, HDFS, HIVE, Impala or JDBC sources, and creating Distributed Model Matrices across a Cluster of Hadoop Nodes in preparation for ML
- A general computation framework where users invoke parallel, distributed MapReduce jobs from R, writing custom mappers and reducers in R while also leveraging open source CRAN packages
- Parallel and distributed Machine Learning algorithms that take advantage of all the nodes of a Hadoop cluster for scalable, high performance modeling on big data. Functions use the expressive R formula object optimized for Spark parallel execution
ORAAH's custom LM/GLM/MLP NN algorithms on Spark scale better and run faster than the open-source Spark MLlib functions, but ORAAH provides interfaces to MLlib as well
- Core Analytics functionality halso available in a standalone Java library that can be used directly without the need of the R language, and can be called from any Java or Scala platform.
