# Oracle Machine Learning sample Notebooks in R language
The sample notebooks on this folder are expected to be used with Oracle Machine Learning for Spark. 

The notebooks available in JSON format are compatible with any open-source Apache Zeppelin notebook environment.

That includes an Apache Zeppelin running on a server (Hadoop Edge Node) that can connect to a Hadoop Cluster, and also the  Oracle Big Data Manager (available in the Oracle Big Data Appliance or Oracle Big Data Cloud Service).
